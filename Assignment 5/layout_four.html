<p> Hello and welcome from CH Bait & Tackle! On this page we will explain in great detail the steps of fishing from picking your fishing spot, choosing your fishing gear, and using your fishing rod to catch fish! We are so glad you choosing to fish CH Bait & Tackle, we've got you covered! </p>


<ol>
  <li>
	Go to a well-stocked lake, river, or pond in your area. Pick a place you won’t mind staying at for several hours. All sorts of different fish live in public lakes, rivers, and ponds, so you can always find something good to catch. The fish come close to the shore in the spring and autumn as they prepare for winter. In the summer, they tend to be in deeper waters, so take a boat out from the shore. </li>
	
  <li>Find out what kind of fish are common in nearby fishing spots. Many newspapers have local fishing reports that list fishing holes and what fish are biting there. You could also ask around at angling shops, marinas, and camping supply stores for tips. There are so many types of fish that getting started can feel a little overwhelming at first, so choose a type of fish to focus on. Bass, crappies, sunfish, bluegills, and catfish are a few varieties that are relatively easy for beginners to reel in.</li>
  
  <li>
	Seek out a specific trophy or food fish you want to catch. If you want to catch a blue marlin, you’re going to need to head out on the ocean. Take some time to read up about the kind of fish you want to catch, where they live, and what kind of bait you need to succeed. Fish populations change from area to area and from freshwater to saltwater. Sometimes you have to plan out a trip to get what you want, but it’s a chance to see something new!</li>
	
	  <li>
	Fish at places near deep water or moving currents. Most big fish spend the days in deeper water and come into shallow areas to feed. They don’t spend a lot of time swimming around these shallow areas. They also don’t like swimming against strong currents, so park yourself at the end of one. Keep an eye out for fish activity, such as bubbles, splashes, or even flocks of hungry birds.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Go out at dawn and dusk to find more fish. The fish come out to feed during these times, so that is your best bet for a big haul. Setting your alarm for 4:30 in the morning isn’t the most fun part of a trip, but it’s worth it when the fish start biting. Take advantage of the early morning hours, especially in the summer, to beat other fishers to your favorite spots.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Get a fishing license from a state department. Visit your government’s website to apply. In the U.S., a Department of Fish and Wildlife or a Department of Natural Resources usually covers applications. Getting a license is easy since all you need to do is type in your personal information and pay a small fee. The license is then sent to your email that day to print out and take with you on your trip.</li>
	
	  <li>
	
	Purchase a medium-strength spinning fishing rod and reel. You might be in awe the first time you check out the rod selection at a sporting goods store, but you don’t need to break the bank. For beginners, stick with a 7 ft (2.1 m), medium-strength rod for something with a good balance of range and flexibility. Select one with a spinning reel, since it is easier to set up and cast than a baitcaster reel.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Choose a monofilament fishing line that fits the length of your rod. Match the fishing line to the kind of pole you have. For a basic 7 ft (2.1 m) rod, go with a 6 to 12 lb (2.7 to 5.4 kg) line if you’re freshwater fishing or a 10 to 12 lb (4.5 to 5.4 kg) line if you’re saltwater fishing. The weight, called the test, tells you how strong the line is. You can only catch fish that weigh less than the line.</li>
	
	  <li>
	
	Select a small hook to lure in a wider variety of fish. Fish only chase after hooks that are about the same size as the bait they chase. A small fish isn’t going to go after a big, intimidating hook. For that reason, start with a 6 to 10 hook to catch plenty of fish. Upgrade to a hook anywhere from 2 to 3/0 to use larger bait for bigger fish.</li>
	
	  <li>
	
	Select a bait like minnows, shrimp, worms, and crickets. If you’re not too fond wriggling creatures, stick with something synthetic. Lures resemble actual bait and will fool fish. Keep in mind that live bait has to be kept in water in an insulated cooler to stay alive. Most fish eat insects and aquatic life, so bait shops offer a wide selection to choose from if you’re looking for a more authentic fishing experience.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Choose an insulated cooler or cage to store caught fish. If you’re planning on keeping what you catch, you need lots of ice to prevent them from spoiling. The easiest way to do this is with a plastic bucket. Add some ice from the cooler along with the dead fish. Keep the fish well-chilled until you get a chance to move them into your freezer at home.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Tie your hook on your line. When you’re first starting out, stick with a simple clinch knot. Thread the line through the hook, then bring it back toward the reel, wrapping it around itself 4 to 6 times. Feed the end back through the loop and pull it tight. Now that you have a basic knot, cut any excess off the tail end of the line with scissors.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Tie weights and bobbers above the hook to help you spot fish. Tie these items with a clinch knot about 12 in (30 cm) above your hook. If you’re taking on swift water, like in a river or stream, use a weight called a sinker so it reaches the fish. If you’re in still waters, a bobber is a small ball that helps you see when a fish grabs onto the hook.</li>
	
	  <li>
	Bait your hook by piercing bait with its tip. Hook through the bait as many times as possible to secure it. Don’t let those fish get away with your hard-earned bait! Hold the hook securely in one hand, then push it straight through the bait. Aim on piercing it 2 or 3 times.</li>
	
	<li>
	
	Cast your line by pulling back and throwing the hook forward. Hold the rod with your dominant hand near the reel. Use the reel to adjust the line, leaving about 6 in (15 cm) of it hanging from the end of the rod. Then, pinch the line to the rod with your thumb and index finger. To cast it, draw your arm back so the rod is vertical, then snap it forward again.</li>
	
	<li>
	
	Wait patiently for a fish to bite. Fishing is a waiting game, so be prepared to wait in silence for something to go for your bait. Some fishers reel in the line slowly, jerking the rod a little to give fish the impression that the bait is alive. If you’re not having any luck sitting back and waiting, try moving the line a little bit.</li>
	
	<li>
	
	Set the hook by raising the pole once the fish bites. When you feel that big tug on your line, "set" your hook to hook the fish. Simply jerk the rod back in the air to point it up in the air like you did when casting the line. Expect the fish to fight back once you hook it. If you no longer feel anything pulling on the line, that means the fish got off and may have swum off with the bait.</li>
	
	<li>
	Pull the fish in by pumping the rod while simultaneously reeling. Lift the rod back up in the air, at about a 45-degree angle, to pull the fish toward you. Doing this puts some tension in the line, so lower the rod again and keep spinning your reel. Reel in the line to remove any slack in it, then lift the rod up again to pull the fish a little closer. Repeat this to bring that catch back to shore.</li>
	
	<li>
	Catch the fish in a net once you’re able to reach it. Once you bring the tired fish close to where you’re standing, swoop in with your water net and catch it. You could have a partner catch it in a fishing net. With experience, you can reach down carefully and do it yourself without losing the fish.</li>
